* [Firefox] Vimium C

** Key
   - gt: next tab
   - gT: previous tab
   - g0: switch to the first tab
   - g$: switch to the last tab
   - x: remove a tab
   - S-x: restore recently closed tabs
   - f : hint all clickable element
 
For example:
* press `f` to hint all clickable elements of the current web page
* press `o` to show a search panel ("Vomnibar", a safe iframe) to search in your history, bookmarks, opened tabs and configured search engines, and you can even remove a history or tab by selecting a search result and pressing Shift+Delete
* press j, k, h, l to scroll down/up/left/right on web pages
* press "/" to search for text; press "v" to enter Visual Mode (just like VIM)
* press Shift+J, Shift+K, `g0`, `g$` to switch to the previous/next/first/last tab
* press `x` to remove a tab, and Shift+X to restore recently closed tabs (sessions), and many other commands
* command repetition: for example, pressing `5X` (`5`, Shift+X) will restore 5 recent closed tabs
* configure key mappings to bind Vimium C's tens of commands to other key sequences, and add options to switch command behaviors
* apply block lists and allow lists of key mappings on configurable special websites and URLs
